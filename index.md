Chirpr is a new kind of social network. It aims to help, rather than damage, mental health. To do this, it turns disadvantages of social media into adavantages rather than line the pockets of large, corrupt corporations. For example:

* We don't show users the likes they've recieved - this reduces comparing oneself to others because you can't
* We show users the likes of posts from people they've followed - this creates a sense of community
* We don't have a trending page - you need to follow users to see their posts. This helps to combat social media addiction

To use Chirpr, you can [download](https://github.com/jacob-macleod/Chirpr-Social-Network) it. However, were looking into hosting Chirpr ourselves, which will mean that you can simply click a link to go to the website, like other networks such as Facebook or Twitter.
