Chirpr aims to benefit users, rather than track them around the web or sell their attention. Simply put, our *users* are not the *product* that we are making money from. In fact,

* Chirpr is completely **free** - we make **no** money at all
* That means we have **no** ads and **no** tracking systems
* Our aim is simply to improve social media for the better
* To achieve this, we've designed Chirpr to **protect** the mental health of our users
